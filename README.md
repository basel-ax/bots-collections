- Multi Exchange Funding Arb(locking for script)
    The strategy aims to exploit funding rate arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges. It is conceptually similar to the v2_funding_rate_arb.py script, but extended and generalized. The main purpose is to capture profitability when funding discrepancies arise between exchanges, while ensuring robust execution and risk management.
